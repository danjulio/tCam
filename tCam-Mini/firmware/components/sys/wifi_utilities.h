// scan finding none of the saved networks raises the camera's own AP within
// seconds of boot, and the periodic rescan below keeps looking underneath.)

// How often the station re-tries the configured network once the recovery AP is
// up.  Each attempt costs a couple of seconds off-channel, which stutters the
// AP anyone is using to fix the configuration - retrying back-to-back made the
// recovery AP barely usable in exactly the situation it exists for.  Thirty
// seconds keeps the auto-rejoin promise while leaving the radio alone.
