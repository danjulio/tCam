# Generate the web app icons embedded in the firmware.
#
# Writes full-bleed ironbow-gradient PNGs with a spot-meter reticle, at the two
# sizes a web app manifest wants.  Full-bleed matters: these are declared
# "maskable", so the platform crops them to its own shape and any margin we add
# would be cropped twice.  The reticle stays inside the central 80% safe zone.
#
# Pure standard library - no Pillow - so the build has no extra dependency.
# Run from main/:  python make_icons.py
